## Kubernetes As The Platform

1. Security (all aspects from apps to cluster)
2. Scanning (cluster, images, etc.)
3. Authentication and authorization
4. Creation (Day One Ops - automation, writing the code to deploy, deployment mechanisms)
5. Management (Day Two Ops - upgrades, maintenance, alerting, monitoring/observability, etc.)
6. Proper SLA's, HA, and scaling
7. Proper teams (who's managing what?)
